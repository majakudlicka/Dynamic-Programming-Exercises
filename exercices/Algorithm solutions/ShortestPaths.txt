Given a directed graph with edge weights w(e), find a shortest path from starting point s to any point z ∈ V in the graph.
Weights can be negative.

For i :1->n
    D(0,s) = 0
    D(0,z) = Infinity; s != z

For i:1-> n
    for all z∈V

    D(i,z) = D(i-1, z)

    For all y; y∈E

    if D(i,z) > D(i-1,y) + w(y,z)

    D(i,z) = D(i-1,y) + w(y,z)

    if D(n,z) < D(n-1, z)
    then problem not well defined (negative cycle exists)
    else
    continue

 Return D(n-1, *)
