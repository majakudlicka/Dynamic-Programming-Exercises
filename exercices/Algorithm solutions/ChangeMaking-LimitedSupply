 You are given denominations x1, x2, . . . , xn, and you want to make change for a value v, but you are allowed to
  use each denomination at most once.

  Input: Positive integers x1, x2, . . . , xn; another integer v.
  Output: Can you make change for v, using each denomination xi at most once?

  Input: x0....xn, V


  For i: 0-> n D(v,0) = true

  For v: 1-> V
    For i: 0-> n

     D(v,i)= D(v, i-1) V D(v-xi, i-1 )

      else D(v,i) = false;

  return D(n,V)
