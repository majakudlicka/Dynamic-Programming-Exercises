A subsequence is palindromic if it is the same whether read left to right or right to
left. For instance, the sequenceA, C, G, T, G, T, C, A, A, A, A, T, C, G
has many palindromic subsequences, including A, C, G, C, A and A, A, A, A. Devise an algorithm
that takes a sequence x1, x2, . . . , xn and returns the length of the longest palindromic
subsequence.

Let P(i, k) = Palindromic Sequence starting at i of length k

For i: 1-> n
    P(i, 1) = 1

For i: 1->n
    if xi = x(i+1)
        P(i, 2) = 2
    else
        P(i,2) = 1

For k:3->n
    For i:1->n-k+1
        if (x(i-1) = x(i+k)
            P(i, k) = P(i+1, k-2)
        else
            P(i,k) = Max(P(i, k-1), P(i+1, k-1))


return P(1,n)
